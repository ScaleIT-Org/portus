### Web interface for Docker registry

Portus provides quick access to all the images available on your private
instance of Docker registry. User's privileges are taken into account to
make sure private images (the ones requiring special rights also for
`docker pull`) are not shown to unauthorized personnel.

## Deploying
1. run sh script
    ./start.sh
2. docker-compose up -d
